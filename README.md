STUDENT PROJECT
JAVA

OBJECTIVE
Create priorities for containers in a cloud environment and dynamically adjust bandwidth for containers.

DESCRIPTION
This simulation creates:
  1 host 
  5 VMs
  10 containers
  100 requests

Each container has a priority and is assumed to run one application
Each request will require a different bandwidth 

Traffic be scheduled based off of priority.
