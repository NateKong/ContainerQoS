# ContainerQoS
Simulation of QoS for Containers

STUDENT PROJECT
JAVA

OBJECTIVE
Create priorities for containers in a cloud environment and dynamically adjust bandwidth for containers.

DESCRIPTION
This simulation creates:
  1 host 
  5 VMs
  100 containers

Each container runs one cloudlet (application)
Each cloudlet will require a different bandwidth and have a different priority

Traffic be scheduled based off of priority.
